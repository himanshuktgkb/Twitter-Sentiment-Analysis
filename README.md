# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis


In this project, I am predicting the sentiments of the public regarding political leaders in India. I am focusing on two popular leaders: Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi. I am comparing the positive and negative sentiments of these two leaders to predict the election results. If one of the two leaders has more positive sentiments, then they will win. For sentiment analysis, I am using four models: VADER, BERT, AFINN, and spaCyTextBlob. Before applying these models, I am taking the dataset in the form of a CSV and cleaning it before analyzing the sentiments. 
Currently I am working on the front end of this project using flask if it completes then I will add it to the repository .
